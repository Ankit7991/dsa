### Strings Are

UNICODE CHARACTERS

It's mutable in some languages like C++

but Immutable in most of language .. hence .. 

### Some Special Immutable Functions

#### Compare Function

*operator overloading* Enables string comparison [Except JAVASCRIPTðŸ§¨]

compare string with "==" or "===" based on specific language.

Operator overloading allows you to customize how operators compare custom objects. 

However, this does not apply to built-in types like strings in most languages.



##### operator overloading
If operator overloading is allowed, 
	you can modify the behavior of operators for custom objects. 

In Python, for example, 
	if you define a custom class and implement methods like 
```
	__eq__ for equality (==)
```
	you can customize how the == operator behaves for instances of that class.



###### Python

In Python, you can overload operators for custom classes. 

For example, implementing methods like `__eq__` allows you to customize how the `==` operator behaves for instances of that class.

###### JavaScript

In JavaScript, you use `==` or `===` for direct string comparison. 

Operator overloading is not supported for modifying comparison behavior of built-in types like strings.
