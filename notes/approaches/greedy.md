Greedy Approach

- First I have used greedy approach in Djkstra (dike-struh) algorighm to find the shortest path.

- however it's not limited to that

- We can use it in 
	- Scheduling (Eg. which task finished first)
	- Transaction handling (Eg. To provide change efficiently)
		- Eg. in lemonade task .. on leetcode


- https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/description/
	- Here We give change from highest denominator to lowest that's why it's greedy approach
